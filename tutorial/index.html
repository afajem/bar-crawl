            <p>You've started the Chicago Bar Crawl app!</p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at:
                <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
                Check in <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing you will see is the map of Chicago Wrigleyville neighborhood, centered around Wrigley Field.
                Double click anywhere on the map to generate a bar crawl route starting at that location.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2>Play, Spring and GIS</h2>
            <p>
                The app shows how to use Play Framework, Spring and Open Street Map data to create a simple GIS application.
            </p>
            <p>
                The architecture of the app is very simple - it receive an AJAX request from the browser with starting bar crawl location,
                loads all the street segments within a mile of that location from an embedded GeoDB database,
                queries Foursquare to get all the bars in the same area,
                and then produces a path that tries to maximize the number of popular bars on it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>GIS</h2>
            <p>
                The app comes with an embedded GeoDB database that contains all the street segments for Chicago.
                To generate it, we've downloaded the map of Chicago from Open Street Map, and then converted it into routable
                street segments by using <a href="http://osm2po.de/">osm2po</a> library. As a result,
                we have a graph representation of all  the streets (walk_2po.gph), as well
                as a <a href="#code/conf/test/default/1.sql" class="shortcut">sql script</a> to load the streets into a database
                for proximity querying.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Spring</h2>
            <p>
                We use Spring to wire everything together. Main
                <a href="#code/app/Application.java" class="shortcut">Application</a> controller relies on <code>@Autowired</code>
                <a href="#code/app/services/RouteProvider.java" class="shortcut">RouteProvider</a>,
                <a href="#code/app/services/TourGuide.java" class="shortcut">TourGuide</a> and
                <a href="#code/app/services/ZoneService.java" class="shortcut">ZoneService</a> services
                to produce the final route.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Spring Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                We use annotation-based Spring config. To setup it up with Play, we need to override <code>onStart()</code> method
                <a href="#code/app/Global.java" class="shortcut">Global</a> to initialize <code>ApplicationContext</code> with
                <a href="#code/app/configs/AppConfig.java" class="shortcut">AppConfig</a> and
                <a href="#code/app/configs/DataConfig.java" class="shortcut">DataConfig</a> that setup our
                <a href="#code/app/repositories/StreetRepository.java" class="shortcut">Spring Data JPA repository</a> and
                our DB <code>dataSource</code>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Querying GIS data</h2>
            <p>
                Through <a href="#code/app/repositories/StreetRepository.java" class="shortcut">StreetRepository</a> we get all the street segments
                within a mile of our location. <a href="#code/app/services/impl/foursquare/FoursquarePlaceService.java" class="shortcut">PlaceService</a> fetches all bars within a
                mile of our location. Both of these are called in parallel in <a href="#code/app/services/impl/ZoneServiceImpl.java" class="shortcut">ZoneService</a>,
                and we end up with a Zone object which contains a mapping of street segments to all bars located on a particular street. To get this mapping, we're
                "pulling" each bar to the nearest street with the help of GeoTools library.
